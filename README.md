# ðŸ’¥OpenPCB: Manufacturing Double Layer PCBs Using Commodity Laser EngraverðŸ’¥
This guide shows you how to manufacture a double layer PCB with vias and through holes using a relatively low cost (<$2k) commodity fiber laser engraver (ComMarker B4 20W). We provide custom enclosure design files to improve the safety of the engraver as well as 3D-printable clamp rigs to enable repeatable lasing operations on both sides of the PCB with minimal tuning.
